Pick your hometown or a city you are familiar with, and create a schematic map. You can find the slides for the refrence here.

The audience can be tourists (general, or specific types of attractions like pilgrimage, lakes, etc.), or a specific use case (such as cycling, educational institutes, etc.).

You can follow the following steps for your schematic map:

- Scale, Audience & Purpose
- Mental model sketch
- Tracing relevant aspects from OSM
- Abstraction: Grids & geometric shapes
- Simplification Vs Minimal
- Elements of the city
- Visual hierarchy
- Details: Icons, Typography, Legend, Context
