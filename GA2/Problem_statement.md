Find a simple, stand-alone, static visualization and write a short critique on: How effective is it at what it aims to do? What works well and what doesn't? What could be better? (See Week 1, Part 7 lecture video for a briefing of the assignment)

Make your submission as a comment. It should contain:

- Title of the example with one image (add URL reference if it is online)
- Short critique (could be in paragraphs or bullet points)
- You can edit or update your comment up until the submission deadline but do not make multiple comments. If your GitHub username is not your actual name, include it in the comment/comment title.

Here are samples ([sample 1](https://github.com/info-design-lab/DE705-Interactive-Data-Visualization/issues/9), [Sample 2](https://github.com/info-design-lab/DE705-Interactive-Data-Visualization/issues/6) of how this is to be submitted. Use examples that are not used in the samples.
