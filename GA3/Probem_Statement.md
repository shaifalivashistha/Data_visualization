After World War II, antibiotics were considered "wonder drugs", since they were easy cures for what had been intractable ailments. To learn which drug worked most effectively for which bacterial infection, the performance of the three most popular antibiotics on 16 bacteria was gathered. The values in the table represent the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), a measure of the effectiveness of the antibiotic, which represents the concentration of antibiotic required to prevent growth in vitro. The reaction of the bacteria to Gram staining is described by the covariate “gram staining”. Bacteria that are stained dark blue or violet are Gram-positive. Otherwise, they are Gram-negative.

Your task is to design a chart that you believe effectively communicates the data and provide a short write-up (no more than 4 paragraphs) describing your design.

- Your chart image should be interpretable without recourse to your short write-up.
- Do not forget to include a title, axis labels, or legends as needed!

As different visualizations can emphasize different aspects of a data set, you should document what aspects of the data you are attempting to most effectively communicate. Just as important, also note which aspects of the data might be obscured or downplayed due to your visualization design.

In your write-up, you should provide a rigorous rationale for your design decisions. Document the visual encodings you used and why they are appropriate for the data. These decisions include the choice of visualization type, size, color, scale, and other visual elements, as well as the use of sorting or other data transformations. How do these decisions facilitate effective communication?
